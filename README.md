# Quadratic equation solver
### About
A relatively small project written in C (C++) that we made in MIPT summer school. It is made as if it was a large-scale commercial project, while its function is as simple as it gets:	solving a quadratic equation.
### The code includes
- A (mostly) foolproof function that solves quadratics (nRoots)
- Unit tests for said function, inputed from a file
- Error logging
- Functions for comparing floating point nubers
- A main function with auxiliaries that provides interface to the user in the terminal
- Doxygen-compatible documentation
- flags: -h (--help), -c (--calculate), -t (--test)
### Requirements
- Make - for launching makefile
- g++ compiler
- Linux probably, dk, didn't test on other OSs
### Setup process
1. Download from Github
2. Unpack
4. Launch makefile with "make"
5. Launch quadratics -c
6. ???
7. Profit
